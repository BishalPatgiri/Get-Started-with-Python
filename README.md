### Learning point (will improve as a go along)
- We can't manupulate varible defined in global scope inside another scope eg: function. For manupulating we have to add global before that varible inside that function scope and then we can manupulate it. Similarly we can't access variable defined inside a scope from outside the scope. For accessing that variable we have to make it global by using global while defining that variable.

- We can use set() funtion to create an empty set similer to javascript in python also. Set does not contain duplicates.

- We can convert a set to an array by using list({"apple","orange"}) == ["apple","orange"]
