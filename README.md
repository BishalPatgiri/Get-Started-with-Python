### Learning point (will improve as a go along)
- We can't manupulate varible defined in global scope inside another scope eg: function. For manupulating we have to add global before that varible inside that function scope and then we can manupulate it. Similarly we can't access variable defined inside a scope from outside the scope. For accessing that variable we have to make it global by using global while defining that variable.
